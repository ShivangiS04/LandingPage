        <h1>Welcome to Swiggy!</h1>
        <h2>We're startup that is cool!</h2>

        <p>Swiggy is a popular online food delivery platform based in India. 
            It was founded in 2014 by Sriharsha Majety, Nandan Reddy, and Rahul Jaimini. Swiggy allows users to order food from a wide range of restaurants and delivers it to their doorstep.

        </p>
        <p>It's worth noting that specific features, partnerships, and services offered by Swiggy may have evolved or changed since my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. For the most up-to-date and accurate information, I recommend visiting the official Swiggy website or contacting their customer support.</p>
